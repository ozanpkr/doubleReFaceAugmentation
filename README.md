# doubleReFaceAugmentation

## Method
  Improve face classification accuracy with the help of crop image and create two images from raw image
  
## Augmentation Example

<img align="center" src="https://github.com/ghostronintr/doubleReFaceAugmentation/blob/main/figures/face_0.png" width="250" height="250"><img align="left" src="https://github.com/ghostronintr/doubleReFaceAugmentation/blob/main/figures/face_0_left.png" width="250" height="250"><img align="right" src="https://github.com/ghostronintr/doubleReFaceAugmentation/blob/main/figures/face_0_right.png" width="250" height="250">


Second image is raw image and first image is created from left side of raw image and third image is created from right side of raw image

## Requirements

[opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv),pip install opencv-python

[numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy),pip install numpy

## TODO
→Complete train images augmentation

→Create CNN 

→Test with augmentation and without augmentation
